(DONE) I want to install postgreSQL in docker container, and connect typeorm to it.

watch `https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1T44y1W7Si?p=23&spm_id_from=pageDriver&vd_source=9779eafcd5942f600878cfd00a069f84`

make a docker-compose.yml and create a new container.

NOTE: in typeorm, entity is like a table in sql

(DONE) learn decorator in js

(TODO) difference between `PrimaryGenerateColumn` and `PrimaryColumn`??

(TODO) `primary key` and `foreign key` in sql?

in a manyToOne relation, foreign key is usuallt on the `many` side, not on the `one` side?? why?

(TODO) in orm, how the relation works in native sql??? what is relation actuallyï¼Ÿ

there is no `join`, but there is a new column after config relation

NOTE: stop here and learn more about relation in orm

(TODO) right now, I learn about how to write relation by rote. Cannot understand WHY...

need to learn how typeorm implements relation.

(TODO) concept of `cascade`, especially when deleting a foreign key
